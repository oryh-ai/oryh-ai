# Billing accounts: one shape for money and for points

A billing account is **one party's standing balance in one unit**. OFBiz has
the money half of this; the rest is an extension it does not model.

## Why one table

OFBiz's `BillingAccount` is a customer's credit/house account: `accountLimit` is
the ceiling, and the balance comes from the invoices charged to it. Strip that
to its shape and it is *a balance in some unit, with a floor, owned by one
party, moved by a ledger*.

Loyalty points, stored value and coupon quotas are the same object. They have
the same questions (what is the balance, may this movement happen, what expires
when) and the same answers. Splitting them into a second table would have
duplicated the balance, the floor, the owner rule, the ledger, the idempotency
and the expiry — every part except the word "unit".

So `unit_type` sits beside the money case:

| | `unit_type: currency` | `unit_type: points` |
|---|---|---|
| `unit` | a currency code (`CNY`) | a tenant vocabulary entry (`point`, a fuel-card allowance…) |
| typical `credit_limit` | the credit line | 0 — points cannot be overdrawn |
| settled by payments | yes | **never** |
| `expires_at` on entries | refused | the point of the field |

One party may hold several accounts, which is exactly what "assorted points or credit"
means in practice: a customer with stored value, loyalty points and a coupon
quota is three accounts, not three columns on `customers`.

`unit_type` is a constrained column rather than a `type_options` vocabulary for
the same reason `Invoice.direction` is: every guard in the settlement path
branches on it, and a value the tenant could add would leave those guards
undecidable. Money reaching a points balance has to be unrepresentable, not
merely discouraged.

## The balance is a running sum

`billing_accounts.balance` is materialized, and `billing_account_entries` is
the append-only ledger it sums. This is the third instance of a shape already in
the codebase:

| running total | its ledger |
|---|---|
| `inventory_items.quantity_on_hand` | `inventory_item_details` |
| `invoices.applied_amount` | `payment_applications` |
| `billing_accounts.balance` | `billing_account_entries` |

Everything follows from it. An opening balance is the account's first *entry*,
never a field. Every write path — the entries endpoint and the settlement
endpoint alike — funnels through one function, so the floor cannot be reached
around. The integrity audit asserts `balance = sum(entries)` because it is an
identity, and it breaks the same silent way the other two do.

Entry provenance uses the generic `(entity_type, entity_id)` pair, deliberately
*unlike* `payment_applications`' explicit foreign keys. The two references mean
different things: a payment application names the document it settles — a closed
set, on which money correctness depends — while an entry names whatever caused
it, which is open-ended (a payment, an invoice, an order, a birthday grant, a
manual adjustment, or another entry when this one expires it).

## Where it meets settlement

A customer's prepayment is a payment **applied to the account** (OFBiz's
`PaymentApplication.billingAccountId`), which both marks the payment as used and
appends the account's ledger in one transaction. An invoice may be charged to an
account (`invoices.billing_account_id`); drawing the account down is an explicit
entry, not a side effect of issuing the invoice.

**Deposit direction is the owner's, not a constant.** A customer's account
holds *their* money with *us*, so their inbound payment fills it; our account
at a vendor holds *our* money with *them*, so our outbound prepayment fills it.
Before this was owner-aware, a prepayment to a vendor was recorded as a refund
and drove the balance negative. A payment's counterparty must also *be* the
account's owner — one customer's cheque must not fund another's account.

## Charging: who carries a document, and what it occupies

A document charged to an account says **who carries the obligation, never that
it is paid**. Settlement stays exclusively the payment-applications ledger; the
account's ledger stays exclusively real money. What charging changes is one
derived number:

```text
available = balance + credit_limit − exposure
```

where exposure sums what charged documents still stand to draw:

| charged document | occupies |
|---|---|
| an order (`sales_orders`/`purchase_orders.billing_account_id`) | its live total − what **same-account** invoices have billed of it |
| an invoice | its billed total − its `applied_amount` |

Nothing new is stored. `applied_amount` and `balance` are already materialized;
a fourth running sum would have two directions to drift in, so exposure is
derived at read and guard time — the account row is locked (`FOR UPDATE`) while
a charge is checked, so two agents cannot both pass the same remaining credit.

**The occupation starts at the order** because the gap between order and
invoice — an e-commerce wait, a walk-in customer's two-day stock-out, a B2B
delivery months out — is exactly where the same balance must not back two
orders. When the invoice is issued *carrying the same account*, the occupation
transfers to it (the order's share shrinks by what the invoice bills); when the
invoice settles, it ends. One rule, no customer-type branches:

> pay from the account → charge the order; invoice from a charged order → the
> same account travels with it; settle → transfer or pay directly.

An invoice issued **without** the account does not release the order's
occupation — refusing too much is a re-read, releasing credit nothing guards is
a leak. The only invoice charged directly is one that came from no order
(a header-only summary invoice and the like).

### Two shapes, one mechanism

**Prepaid** — the deposit is already in the account; settlement moves it onto
the invoice as ONE atomic multi-line apply, the negative line releasing the
account (ledger reason `charge` — paying a document from the account balance), the positive line
settling the invoice:

```json
POST /payments/{deposit_payment_id}/apply
{"lines": 
  {"applied_to_type": "billing_account", "applied_to_id": "…", "amount_applied": -100},
  {"applied_to_type": "invoice",         "applied_to_id": "…", "amount_applied": 100}
}
```

Which deposit funds which invoice (FIFO or named) is the workspace's rule and
the agent's call — the same stance batch-level points consumption already
takes.

**On credit** — the charged invoice simply stays outstanding, occupying
credit; the customer's later payment applies **directly to the invoice**
(ordinary settlement), and available recovers as outstanding falls. The balance
never moved. A lump-sum remittance works through both shapes at once: deposit
it, then transfer to the invoices it covers.

### Release: the derivation read backwards

Credit returns the moment the occupation expression shrinks — no status word is
ever interpreted:

| cancellation shape | recorded as | credit returns |
|---|---|---|
| partial: fewer/smaller lines | line edit / soft-deleted line | automatically |
| partial: keep lines, reduce commitment | negative adjustment | automatically |
| whole order voided | soft delete | automatically |
| whole order cancelled but kept | **agent clears `billing_account_id`** | on the clear |

The last row is deliberately the agent's write: `cancelled` and `completed`
are both terminal states and mean opposite things for credit, so the release
is irreducibly semantic — the server states the facts, the agent decides what
the tenant's word means. What keeps that honest is not prose: the detail read
lists every charged document with its occupied amount, and the integrity audit
reports orders charged 30+ days with no invoice.

Growth re-guards: adding lines, raising amounts, positive adjustments and
**restores** re-run the occupation check — a delete released credit somebody
may have spent since, so coming back has to fit what is left. Clearing the
charge is never guarded: freeing credit is always safe.

### The mirror

Our account at a vendor is the same object with the directions flipped: prepay
(outbound, recorded as a deposit), charge the purchase order, the vendor's
credit covers what the deposit does not, and settlement transfers our deposit onto
their invoice. Same formula, same guards, same tests — `payroll` invoices are
the one direction that refuses charging, because an employee-owned account
takes deposits and refunds, not obligations.

This is the one target that does not fit the settlement guard's original shape,
which is why `SettlementTarget` carries a running column and two bounds:

| target | running column | floor | ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| invoice | `applied_amount` | 0 | billed total |
| expense claim | `applied_amount` | 0 | items total |
| payment (netting) | `applied_amount` | 0 | its amount |
| **billing account** | `balance` | `-credit_limit` | **none** |

A deposit is not a claim, so there is nothing to over-settle; what it can do is
go too far negative, which is the credit line. And the direction rule inverts:
every other target is settled from exactly one side, while an account takes
deposits in and pays refunds out — so `settling_direction` returns `None` and
the sign of the effect comes from the payment's direction instead.

## The server converts nothing

"500 points off 5 yuan" is **two facts**, recorded separately:

1. a points entry — `-500`, `reason: redeemed`, pointing at the document;
2. a `discount` line on that document for ¥5.

The server will not turn points into money. The rate is a business rule that
belongs in the tenant's workflow definition, and a record layer that quietly
applied one would be inventing policy — the same position that makes
cross-currency settlement a 409 rather than a conversion.

The same line holds for earning rules, tiers, birthday multipliers and which
products earn at all. None of them are here.

## Expiry: facts, and a queue

Entries carry `expires_at` (points only). Expiry itself is a negative `expired`
entry a flow agent writes, and it **names the earn batch it expired** through
the provenance pair. That pointer is what makes
`GET /billing-accounts/{id}/expiring` answerable and the sweep idempotent: the
next pass excludes batches something already expired instead of expiring them
twice.

`expiring_amount` is the batches' sum, **not** the amount that should expire.
How much of a batch survived redemption depends on whether the workspace draws
FIFO, LIFO or from a pool — and the server does not track which batch a
redemption came from.

That gap is deliberate. Batch-level consumption tracking would answer the
question exactly, at the price of a consumption table and of writing FIFO into
the server, where a business rule does not belong. The honest arrangement is
that the server reports the batches and the agent applies the workspace's rule.

## Capabilities

| capability | scopable | holder |
|---|---|---|
| `billing_account.manage` | no | opening accounts, credit limits, freezing, closing |
| `billing_account.post` | `:currency` / `:points` | writing movements |

The split is not ceremony: granting points is the fraud-prone action in this
family, and the scope lets membership operations hold `:points` while finance holds
`:currency` — neither of them able to open an account or change a credit line.
`billing_account.post:*` is in the hosted flow agent's fixed grant set so it can
run the expiry sweep. Neither capability is in the `member` default.

## Deliberately out of scope

- **Multi-party accounts.** OFBiz's `BillingAccountRole` lets several parties
  share one account (a group credit line). Collapsed to a single owner, as `payments` is.
- **`BillingAccountTerm`.** Payment terms live on the documents, not the account.
- **Points-to-money conversion, in any direction.** See above.
- **Batch-level consumption tracking.** See above.
- **Tiers and membership levels.** Tenant-defined objects, not a fixed schema.
