# User manual

Oryh is the AI-native ERP/CRM: the agent your people already use is the
interface, the server keeps the records, and the company's process is prose
the workspace owns. This manual is for the person who deployed it from the
public repository and now has to make it useful to a company. It covers the self-hosted product end
to end: installing it, giving it its first workspace, connecting agents,
loading the company's own records, and keeping it running.

It is not a manual for the hosted service at <https://oryh.ai>. That service
runs the same product, but registration, billing and the platform operator's
side of it are not part of what you deployed.

## The shape of the thing

Oryh is headless. The documents a business runs on live here — employees,
customers and vendors, products, quotations, orders, invoices in both
directions, payments, payroll, timesheets, expense claims, leave — but the
work of creating and moving them happens through **agents**, not through
pages. A person asks their own AI agent to file a timesheet; the agent uses a
skill your workspace issued it, and the server records the fact.

That leaves the browser console with a narrower job than an ERP's UI usually
has: it administers the workspace. Who exists, what they may do, which skills
reach them, what the master data is, and what actually happened. Read
[administration](administration.md) for what each screen is for.

Two consequences worth absorbing before you start:

- **A fresh workspace is empty on purpose.** No employees, no customers, no
  documents. The first useful step after signing in is not clicking around —
  it is [connecting an agent](connect-agent.md).
- **Most of "how we do it here" is prose, not configuration.** Skills are
  markdown, approval routing is a document the flow agent reads, lifecycle
  state names are your own words. Changing behaviour is usually a sentence to
  an agent rather than a change request.

## Read in order

| Step | Page |
|---|---|
| 1 | [Install](install.md) — requirements, the four services, configuration |
| 2 | [First boot](first-boot.md) — the credentials printed once, and signing in |
| 3 | [Connect your agent](connect-agent.md) — the device flow and the skill bundle |
| 4 | [Set up the workspace](workspace.md) — people, access, master data, rules |
| 5 | [Daily use](daily-use.md) — what each role actually does |
| 6 | [Administration](administration.md) — the console, screen by screen |
| 7 | [Operations](operations.md) — backup, upgrade, email, troubleshooting |

For why things are modelled the way they are, the design notes are separate
reading: [capabilities and skills](https://github.com/AIE-enginehub/Oryh/blob/main/docs/capabilities-skills-api.md),
[the device flow](https://github.com/AIE-enginehub/Oryh/blob/main/docs/device-flow.md), and the business-object notes.
