# Administration

The console administers the workspace. It is not where the work happens — that
is [daily use](daily-use.md) — but it is where you check what the work did,
and where the exceptions get handled.

It is available in Chinese and English; the switch is in the interface.

## Dashboard

Workspace status and the latest overview, plus the way into everything below.
A screen you check, not one you work in.

## People & access

| Screen | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Users & invitations** | Sign-in identities. Invite, disable, set roles. |
| **Roles & permissions** | Named bundles of capabilities. |
| **Employee profiles** | Personnel records — name, employee number, the person documents refer to. |

Users and employees are different records and either can exist without the
other; [set up the workspace](workspace.md) explains why that matters.

Role names are lowercase with underscores. A capability is a verb, sometimes
scoped to an object type. What a person's agent may do is exactly what their
role grants — decided by the credential presented, never by what the caller
claims about itself.

## Master data

Projects, vendors, products and SKUs (with their category tree, pictures and
bills of materials), sales channels, stores, facilities, resources — each
with filtering and paging. Customers have their own screen, with their
contacts and price agreements. These are reference screens; bulk loading
belongs to `oryh-master-data`.

## Objects & rules

| Screen | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Object types & workflows** | Field rules, status flow, workflow versions — for shipped documents and your own types alike. |
| **Business objects** | Every record in the workspace, with a detail view. |

Built-in entities require a state-machine definition; your own types need a
field schema and a lifecycle in your own vocabulary. Both are administrator
territory, and both are gated: an account without workspace-configuration
permission is told so rather than shown a broken screen. A custom type may
not take the name of something shipped (`customer`, `product`, `quote`…);
the server refuses it and names the real collection.

## Activity records

| Screen | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **To-dos** | The human work queue — the workspace's, and your own. |
| **Approval log** | The complete, immutable approval history. |

The approval log is a read-only audit view, and reading it is itself a
permission. An account without it is told it lacks permission rather than
shown an empty table.

"My to-dos" needs an employee profile to be about. An account with no linked
employee record is told exactly that — it is a real state, not an error.

## Skills, distribution and credentials

| Screen | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **Skills** | Which skills exist and who each one reaches. |
| **Access credentials** | API keys. Issue, label, disable. |
| **Flow agent** | Whether unattended flow driving moved anything, and whether more is waiting. |

The skills screen exists to answer one question at a glance: **who does this
skill reach?** A skill aimed at named people with nobody actually named is
shown as *targeted · nobody* — a real state, and one worth catching, because
it reaches no one while looking configured. The exception is shown as
*runner only*: the approval-flow skills ship targeted with nobody named,
because the hosted flow agent drives them and ignores audience. They stay out
of every person's bundle by default; name a person on one only to let them
take a flow over by hand.

Access credentials is where you issue an agent key without needing the
bootstrap key from first boot, and where you disable one that leaked. A key
can be unusable for reasons that are not about the key — its user is disabled,
or was never activated — and the screen distinguishes those cases rather than
reporting a flat failure.

The flow agent screen has one state worth knowing by name: **parked**. The
runner stops a subscription after several runs in a row that found documents
waiting and moved none of them — almost always because the workflow
definition for that family does not say where those documents go. A parked
subscription stays enabled and does nothing until a person lifts the stop.
Two things lift it: publishing the next version of that family's workflow
definition (the usual fix, and the park clears by itself), or `PATCH
/flow-subscriptions/{id}` with `clear_park: true` when the cause was
elsewhere — an approver without an employee record, say. The setup report
lists parked subscriptions with their reason under `flow_driving`. An agent
holding `keys.manage` can read the subscription and clear the park; nothing
about it needs the platform operator.

## The API

The console is compiled against the same contract you can read:

- `/redoc` — the API, documented from the schema
- `/openapi.json` — the contract itself

Anything the console does, an agent can do.
